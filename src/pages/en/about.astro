      My name is HÃ©ctor Aldair Aguilar. I'm a front-end developer who enjoys
      making websites. I love the web with all its weirdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just my little personal place on the web where I post some stuff
      that I learn over the years, book recommendations, and logs from the gym
      exercises
    </p>
    <p>This website will be constantly changing over time and that's funny.</p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm working with Design Systems and making the web accessible
      for everyone
    </p>

      I work at <a href="https://clip.mx" target="_blank">Clip</a>
      as a Senior Software Engineer. React is my bread and butter, but I enjoy working
      on the fullstack side too.

      When I'm not writing code, I enjoy going to the gym, cooking and learning
      about gastronomy. Recently I started to get in to <a
